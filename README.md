# Sci-Bi

Sci-Bi is a collection of sci-fi inspired pixel fonts I made !

## Sci-Bi

- (Almost) Full support of accented characters
- Custom Spacing for each letter, to achieve a compact look
- I recommend that you set the size font at at least 18

## Sci-Bi Glitched

- Small Glitched effect on letter and numbers for flair
- Same as Sci-Bi in every aspect otherwise
