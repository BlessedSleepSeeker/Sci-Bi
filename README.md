# Sci-Bi

Sci-Bi is a collection of sci-fi inspired pixel fonts I made !

## Sci-Bi Full

- (Almost) Full support of accented characters
- Custom Spacing for each letter, to achieve a compact look
- I recommend that you set the size font at at least 18

## Sci-Bi All Caps With Glitches

- All Caps, no lowercase letters.
- Misses a lot (all) of accented characters
- Monospace Spacing
- *Not recommended for anything else than titles*
